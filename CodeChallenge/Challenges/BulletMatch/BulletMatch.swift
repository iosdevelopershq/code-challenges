/**
 Forensic specialists examine spent cartridges for unique
 markings left by parts of a gun. They can then compare
 these markings to the ones in any gun to determine if there
 is a match. A match means that the bullet was fired from 
 that gun.
 
 Given two markings, one from a spent cartridge and the other
 from a suspected weapon, both as Strings, return true if they match
 and false if they don't.
 
 EXAMPLES:
 Match, returns true
 "| |||  |   |" and
 "| |||  |   |"
 
 Match, returns true though one is rotated. Bullets can be rotated.
 Your solution should account for the possible rotation of bullets.
 "|| ||| | " and
 " | || |||"
 
 Doesn't match, returns false
 "| |||  |   |" and
 "||| |  |   |"
 
 NOTE: Markings cannot be flipped. 
 "| ||" is not a match for
 "|| |"
